# REMIX'd CLI App 

REMIX'd is a CLI application that shows the samples behind some of your favorite songs. It was made using Ruby, TTYPrompt, and ActiveRecord with a few splashes of ASCII art dropped in. 

## Usage

To see the CLI in action, run the following command: 

```rb
ruby bin/run.rb
```

## Build On!
Feel free to take this code and (finish it, because it's not done :D ) build your own CLI application! Pull requests are welcomed. Have fun!
